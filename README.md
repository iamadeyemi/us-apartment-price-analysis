# 📊 Unlocking Rental Market Trends: Analyzing Apartment Prices and Features Across the U.S  

## 🏡 Introduction  

The U.S. rental market is constantly evolving, influenced by economic conditions, demographic shifts, and urban development. This study investigates key factors such as **location, amenities, and floor space** to analyze their impact on rental pricing. The findings empower **renters, landlords, and policymakers** with valuable insights into market trends and housing affordability.  

## 🎯 Objectives  

- **Data Preparation & Cleaning**: Identify key factors affecting rental prices.  
- **Model Development**: Implement **Multiple Linear Regression** and **Binomial Logistic Regression** for price prediction.  
- **Evaluation & Insights**: Assess model performance and extract actionable insights for market forecasting.  

## 📌 Methodology  

This research follows a **data-driven approach**, including:  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing patterns and trends in rental prices.  
✅ **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**: Identifying relationships between apartment features and price.  
✅ **Binomial Logistic Regression**: Classifying rental properties into **high** or **low-priced** categories.  
✅ **Model Evaluation**: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.  

## 📊 Key Findings  

🔹 **Pricing Trends**: Rental prices increase with **square footage and number of bathrooms**, but surprisingly, **more bedrooms do not always mean higher prices**.  
🔹 **Market Insights**: **Texas** leads with the highest apartment listings, followed by **California and Washington**.  
🔹 **Regression Models**:  
   - **MLR** explains ~22.5% of price variance, indicating moderate predictability.  
   - **Logistic Regression** classifies properties with **~68% accuracy**, highlighting useful pricing patterns.  

## 📌 Future Scope  

To enhance predictions, future research could include:  
✔️ **Neighborhood factors** (crime rate, school ratings).  
✔️ **Economic conditions** (inflation, employment rate).  
✔️ **Advanced modeling** (machine learning for higher accuracy).  

## 🚀 Conclusion  

This study provides a **data-backed approach** to understanding U.S. rental prices.
